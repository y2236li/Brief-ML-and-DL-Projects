The program is building a simple Neural Network without any deep learning package


> 1. Include a dummuy variable value of which is one throughout all sample points so that we can get intercept value
> 2. Assign random weight to each of the variables and make prediction using dot product of the random weight and variable values
> 3. Using a cost function (cross entropy for example) to compute the loss of the target observations.
> 4. Calculate the derivatives of the cost function with respect to the weight and the bias
> 5. Update the weight and bias by mutiplying the weight and bias derivatives with learning rate
> 6. Iterate step 4 and 5 until the change in weights is insignificant

Notice: The Following text are refered from https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/marketing-funnel-olist/home

The dataset has information of 8k Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) that requested contact between Jun. 1st 2017 and Jun 1st 2018. They were randomly sampled from the total of MQLs.

Its features allows viewing a sales process from multiple dimensions: lead category, catalog size, behaviour profile, etc.

This is real data, it has been anonymized and sampled from the original dataset.
