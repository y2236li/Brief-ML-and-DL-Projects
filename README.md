## Build NN from strach

The program is building a simple Neural Network without any deep learning package

___
> 1. Include a dummuy variable value of which is one throughout all sample points so that we can get intercept value
> 2. Assign random weight to each of the variables and make prediction using dot product of the random weight and variable values
> 3. Using a cost function (cross entropy for example) to compute the loss of the target observations.
> 4. Calculate the derivatives of the cost function with respect to the weight and the bias
> 5. Update the weight and bias by mutiplying the weight and bias derivatives with learning rate
> 6. Iterate step 4 and 5 until the change in weights is insignificant

**Conclusion:**<br>

> The model achieved 99% accuracy on training data and 70% on testing data
